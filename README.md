I’m David Petkov.

### About me

I’ve built over 30 complete projects — many of them done as a hobby or for small businesses and competitions. These range from simple web apps to full-scale microservice platforms using .NET and other technologies.

I’ve won 10 national awards in IT. In 2024, I led a team of 8 developers on **MealMaster**, a smart kitchen assistant — I was responsible for the technical direction of the project.

Right now, I’m working on building **Devids**, an IT company co-founded with David Hristov. Our goal is to create software that solves real-world problems across different industries.

### What drives me

My goal is to create value.

I build things that matter. That’s the only kind of wealth that counts.
